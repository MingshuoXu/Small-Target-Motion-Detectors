4(Python). Perfecting <reqiurement.txt> and <setup.py> in Python


------------------------------------------
Update -version 2.0.3 (April 30, 2024)

3(Python). Upload part of python code.
4(naming_conventions) Update the convention of type naming.


------------------------------------------
Update -version 2.0.2 (March 12, 2024)

1(Matlab). Corrected the implementation of the FeedbackSTMD model.
2(Matlab). Added evaluation code for the RIST dataset.
3(Matlab). Added gitignore file.


------------------------------------------
Update -version 2.0.1 (March 08, 2024)

1(Matlab). GitHub renaming the download package from "Small-Target-Motion-Detectors" 
    to "Small-Target-Motion-Detectors-main" caused issues with addpath. In this update, 
    this problem have been addressed by ensuring that addpath is not reliant on 
    the name "Small-Target-Motion-Detectors". Instead, it now identifies 
    "/matlab/smalltargetmotiondetectors/" to prevent addpath from being affected by GitHub's changes.
2(Matlab). By changing the format of the demo dataset from TIFF to JPG, 
    the size of the demodata has been reduced from 70MB to 12MB.


------------------------------------------
first commit -version 2.00 (March 07, 2024)

This project is a comprehensive upgrate of the previous version (Version 1, 
    https://github.com/MingshuoXu/ClassSTMD), mainly changing the implementation 
    framework by separating the model from the core functionality, making it more 
    convenient for combination.

1(Matlab). Separation of Model and Core Functionality: In this version, we 
    have separated the implementation of the model from the core functionality, 
    making it easier to develop and maintain them independently. This design 
    facilitates users to combine and extend models according to their needs.
2(Matlab). Framework Update: We have adopted a new implementation framework, 
    improving code readability and scalability. The new framework makes the code 
    clearer, easier to understand, and modify.
3(Matlab). Performance Optimization: By optimizing and refactoring the code, 
    we have improved the performance and efficiency of the model. The new version 
    maintains accuracy while enhancing processing speed and resource utilization.
